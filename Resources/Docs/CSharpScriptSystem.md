# Electro ScriptEngine

**Electro uses Mono to establish C# bindings with the C++ engine code. All the code writing, compiling is LIVE and doesn't require the engine to shutdown. You can take the taste of it yourself via [building the ExampleApp](https://github.com/FahimFuad/Electro/blob/master/Resources/Docs/Setup.md#building-the-example-project).
So run the `ExampleApp.sln` and build it via the build button, it will generate a `.dll` file. Now run the engine, and create an entity+ attach a `ScriptComponent` with that. Enter the class name, you wrote in ExampleApp, an you are good to go!**
