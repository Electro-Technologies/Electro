# Cloning Electro

Clone the repository with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/FahimFuad/Electro.git` to clone along with the submodules. If you have already cloned and you want to initialize the submodules, type `git submodule init` and to update the submodules type `git submodule update` in your project directory. Of course you can use Git clients like Gitkraken, Fork, Github Desktop etc. It is upto you how you clone it, just be sure to do a *recursive* clone to fetch the submodule(s).

- Visual Studio 2019 is the only IDE on Windows, you have to use Visual Studio 2019 in order to Develop Electro with it on Windows
- Run the `WindowsGenProjects.bat` file inside the scripts folder and CMake will generate a `Electro.sln` file inside the `build` folder on the root directory. Open that file and hit the run button to build the engine!
